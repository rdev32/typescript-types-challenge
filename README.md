Collection of TypeScript type challenges<br>
</p>

## Intro

High-quality types can help improving projects' maintainability while avoiding potential bugs.

There are a bunch of awesome type utility libraries may boosting your works on types, like [ts-toolbelt](https://github.com/millsp/ts-toolbelt), [utility-types](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types), [SimplyTyped](https://github.com/andnp/SimplyTyped), etc, which you can already use.

This project is aimed at helping you better understand how the type system works, writing your own utilities, or just having fun with the challenges.

## Instructions

There are typescript test cases setup for each challenge. Complete as many challenges as possible. You can check your work with:

```
yarn tsc
